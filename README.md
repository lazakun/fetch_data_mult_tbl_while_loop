Request:
- I want to query (using a stored procedure or SQL script) multiple large similar (same schema) tables residing in the database
- I want to know the table that populates the data based on my script or stored procedure

Challenges
- Querying each tables is manual and time consuming
- Merging the tables would create an even larger table ann querying will also be time consuming

Proposed Solution:
- Get a list of the tables to be queried
- Use while loop function to loop through each tables while running the script/sp against them
